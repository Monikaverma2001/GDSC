<ul>
 <li> <b>What is your motivation to run a Google Developer Student Club at your Institution?</b><br>
My motivation to run Google Developer Student Club at my College is my college student's hardwork in Developing new things using different technologies without even having much knowledge of Developer groups or communities in my college . I have been leading 200+ students in my college by taking webinars and events in my college. yes , i am a part of technical team member of ITIAN CLUB of my college.here we organise technical enjoyable events . the students of any department can take part in it and get the benefit and earn winning prizes as per event. here, we also organise workshops on various modern technologies example we organise 3 days free workshop of figma. if i will be the part of GDSC we will able to grow network and we organise these such events and workshop in another nearby colleges also. as I believe in peer-to-peer learning.Since, i can't able to provide full guidance and opportunity to my hardworking college students due to lack of Developer group memebers in my college. So for giving them guidance and opportunity and want to create developer enviornment to my college student's I want to be DSC member from my college.</li>
